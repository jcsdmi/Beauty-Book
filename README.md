## Overview
### Description
A beauty centered social media that let's users share and view step by step guides on all things beauty.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Media/Beauty
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for mobile devices so that users could view step-by-step guides whenever, and wherever they want. 
- **Story:** Provides the user with step-by-step guides on how to do different hairstyles, makeup, and nail designs. The user can search guides for what they want to learn, or post their own guides to teach others.
- **Market:** The primary market of this app would be girls and women.
- **Habit:** The more beauty related things a user wants to learn, the more they would use the app. If the user isn't searching for how to do something, they could give back to the community by adding more guides.
- **Scope:** Firstly, the focus would be on learning and teaching different beauty techniques. Potentially beauty (makeover, dressup, nail art, etc.) games could be added to make the app more engaging.
